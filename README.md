# Sequence
The items in a sequence are stored in the private member variable of many_nodes. The items are put into linked lists. The list head pointer is called head_ptr 
and the list end pointer is tail_ptr. They both point to NULL when the sequence is empty. The current item is pointed towards the private member variable called cursor. There is also the precusor which points to the previous node from cursor. If 
there is no current item then they are set to NULL.
